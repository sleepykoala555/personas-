        <h1>0. Introduction:</h1>
        <p class="text">In this Operation Fried Waffles, you will uncover a “secret” of Brown’s Science Libary
          (known as “Scili”), and follow the clues to unveil the identity of the legendary Dr. Fitz.
          To accomplish this mission, you need to explore the different floors of Scili, so the elevators will be your
          best friend.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> Thus, you’ll first need to learn about the control panels of the elevators and their
          limitations, by observing
          and interviewing three people – Lisa, Sunny, and Jerry, about their experiences of interacting with the
          interfaces. After that,
          you’ll befriend two personas that typify common user behaviors and frustrations.
          And finally, you’ll join Ben’s adventure and follow his journey to unlock various locations in Scili and find
          the legendary Dr. Fitz.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> The purpose of this exercise is to allow you to better understand how users interact with a
          common interface,
          as banal as the button panel of an elevator, and think about how details matter.
        </p>

              get noticed which of the three elevators is approaching soon.

              <td>
                <p>1) Lisa tries to go to the third floor from the first floor to see Doctor Geraldine Fitzgerald, the
                  salamander in the Science Centre (floor 3) on a Friday night.</p>
                <p>2) However when in the elevator, she presses floor 3 but the button doesn't light up. </p>
                <p>3) Lisa tried using the stairs to go to floor 3 but still could not open the door. </p>
                <p>4) Lisa goes back to the ground level instead and asks the guard instead. She is told the Science
                  Center is closed over the weekend. </p>
                <p>5) “That’s why I don’t like coming here,” Lisa comments. </p>

              </td>
              <td>
                <p>1) Lisa is a fourth-year grad student from China. Lisa comes to the Science Library only 2-3 times
                  per year, the least frequent among the 3 interviewees.</p>
                <p>2) As the only interviewee who went to a restricted level(floor 9) for an invited event before, she
                  had to swipe her student card before pressing the floor number button, a confusing experience for her.
                </p>
                <p>3) Lisa is confused about the meanings of L, A, and M. She is used to seeing G for the ground floor,
                  LL for the basement, and 2 for the mezzanine. </p>
                <p>4) Lisa did not know which floors are accessible and what functions they serve given the limited info
                  on the interfaces, and thus had very limited usage and knowledge of the lding. Several times, she had
                  to turn to the guard/receptionist for help to know which floor she should go to.</p>
                <p>5) Lisa suggests that labels can be put with numbers, and have some signs to indicate accessibility.

                <p>1) Sunny is waiting for the elevator on the 13th floor after finishing studying and wants to go to
                  the ground floor to grap a quick lunch.</p>
                <p>2) After about 30s waiting, Sunny starts to feel impatient so she decides to quickly fill her water
                  bottles and come back. </p>
                <p>3) When she’s back, the elevator has left so she has to press the button and wait again. </p>
                <p>4) “Damn, again!?” Sunny signed. </p>


              </td>
              <td>
                <p>1) Sunny is a senior from Singapore. She comes to the Scili frequently for a variety of reasons, and
                  she has explored many different floors. </p>
                <p>2) Sunny was first confused about the meanings of L, A, and M. She would use B for the basement, G or
                  1 for the ground floor, and 2 for the mezzanine. </p>
                <p>3) Sunny did not know which floors are accessible and usable in the first place so she tried pressing
                  all of the buttons to see which ones would work, which was frustrating. She attributed the underuse of
                  Scili by many students to limited information on the interfaces.</p>
                <p>4) Sunny enjoyed going to the 12th/13th floor to study in the cubicles, a place unknown to many
                  students. However, waiting for elevators on these two floors is frustrating and can a long time. </p>
                <p>5) Sunny suggests putting up a QR code for detailed info outside the elevator/on the elevator’s door
                  for accessibility, opening times, and functions of each floor. Also, Sunny wants to see which floors
                  the elevators are to better estimate the waiting time. </p>

                  self-studying in Scili. </p>
                <p>2) Entering the lyft, Jerry is unsure about which floor to go. He’s not sure about what are floor A
                  and floor M. </p>
                <p>3) He takes out his phone and starts googling. In the end, he decides that he wants to go to floor 4,
                  the quiet studying floor. </p>
                <p>4) However, the rooms and tables are filled so he has to leave and presses both floors M and A to
                  see. </p>

              </td>
              <td>
                <p>1) Jerry is a freshman student from Michigan. He has only visited the Scili one or two times during
                  the orientation. </p>
                <p>2) He vividly remembered the first time he went to Scili, he had no idea of what the M meant and felt
                  frustrated by the fact he could not find floor 2. </p>
                <p>3) Jerry thought only levels A, L, and M are accessible to students so that’s why letters are used,
                  while all other floors have restricted access. </p>
                <p>4) Jerry agrees waiting for Scili’s elevators is frustrating because cannot see their positions.</p>
                <p>5) Jerry suggests that relevant information could have been provided during the orientation because
                  the elevators in Scili are old so their interfaces are old and confusing to use.</p>

                  did you gain access?
                  Other than the floors you visit the most/visited before, do you know about
                  the functions and usage of other floors? If yes, How did you go about finding
                  out the information? If not, have you wondered or wanted to explore other
                  floors, and what stopped you?

                  Fun fact test: Do you know who is Doctor Geraldine Fitzgerald and where can
                  we find her in the Scili? Do you know what will be the days and times you can
                  visit her?

              <h3>Suggestions and Additional Information:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>What changes in design could have been implemented to interface 1 to
                  improve the experience of waiting for the elevators? </li>
                <li> What could have been done to interface 2 to make the experience of using
                  the button panel better and smoother for you(accurately pressing the right
                  button without confusion)?</li>
                <li>What changes could have been made to the button panel to help you better
                  navigate and utilize the Science Library(knowing the accessibility and function
                  of each floor)? </li>
                <li>Other than the aspects mentioned above, are there other things about the
                  interfaces that confuse you and/or delight you? </li>
                <li>Any additional features or functions you want to see on the interfaces? (Can
                  be very creative here) </li>
                <li> Other feedback, stories, or relevant information?</li>
